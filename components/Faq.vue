        answer: 'If you think it\'s important to the frontend community, go ahead and add it. Adding JS libraries can be a tad trickier because if we were to include every single JS package in this calendar, it\'d be way too big. I think we should only list the relevant packages here, so you got to decide for yourself if a library is worth adding.'
